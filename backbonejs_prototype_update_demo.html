   //The script below is to demo how easy it is to add more to functionality to methods standard provided by backbone.js prototypes.
   //This example takes the Backbone.View.prototype and demos how to add more to the render method, create a new version of render(say myrender),
   //or create a new event(say mynewevent) 
   _.extend(Backbone.View.prototype, Backbone.Events, {
   	 render: function() {
   	 	console.log('This is a test');
      //this.mynewevent();
      return this;
      
    },
     myrender: function() {
     	console.log('Pre-render work');
     	this.render();
     },
     mynewevent: function() {
     	console.log('This is my new event');
     }
  });
 
  var testView = Backbone.View.extend({
  });
    
  var testview = new testView();
  testview.render(); //console logs the test message for every call to render
  testview.myrender();//calls the new version of render which can do some pre-render work than call render
    					//if the call to mynewevent() is uncommented, the render method makes a call to our new event as well
